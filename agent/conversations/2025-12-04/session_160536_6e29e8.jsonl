The system is requiring additional filter parameters that aren't available through the current search function.\n\n**Issue**: The NowCerts API is returning a 400 error indicating that either specific filters need to be selected or additional parameters (Top, Skip, OrderBy) are required.\n\n**Recommendation**: \n- Do you have a more specific company name that includes \"LDJ\" (like \"LDJ Transport\" or \"LDJ Trucking\")?\n- Or do you have their DOT number, phone number, or email address? These might work better as search terms.\n- Alternatively, you may need to search directly in the NowCerts system through their web interface.\n\nWhat additional information do you have about this insured that might help with the search?", "tab_state": {"url": "chrome://newtab/", "title": "New Tab"}, "ts": "2025-12-04T23:05:57.221737Z"}
