I can store and recall information that's important for our work at RMS Trucks.\n\nHere's how my memory works:\n\n**What I can remember:**\n- **Carriers** - Notes about specific DOT numbers, companies, past quotes, issues, preferences\n- **Patterns** - Safety correlations, pricing trends, industry insights I discover\n- **General** - Important decisions, processes, or anything work-related\n\n**Memory functions:**\n- `remember(subject, note, category)` - Store information for later\n- `recall(subject)` - Get everything I know about a topic\n- `list_carrier_notes()` - See all carriers I have notes on\n- `log_daily(entry)` - Track significant daily events\n\n**Example workflow:**\nIf you ask me to look up DOT 1234567, I'll first check `recall(\"1234567\")` to see if I have any previous notes about that carrier. Then I'll combine that historical context with fresh data from FMCSA, Close CRM, and NowCerts.\n\nThis helps me provide better context and avoid repeating work we've already done. For instance, if we've already determined a carrier is high-risk or has special requirements, I'll remember that for future reference.\n\nWant me to show you what I currently have stored, or is there something specific you'd like me to remember about a carrier or process?", "tab_state": {"url": "https://www.espn.com/", "title": "ESPN - Serving Sports Fans.
